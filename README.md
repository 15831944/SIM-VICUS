```


## Repo-Documentation

The `README.md` files are written with MarkDown syntax, GitHub flavour, so that they can be read in the web-view of github.
All extensive documentation is written in AsciiDoctor format inside the doc directory.

Source code documentation is done with Doxygen, which generates its documentation for the _entire_ src directory and stores
the output in `docs/api`.
